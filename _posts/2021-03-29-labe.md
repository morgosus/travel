Labe is the river flowing through Neratovice and many other Czech towns. There main thing I like about labe is the 
surplus of animals everywhere. If you come in during Spring or Summer, you'll be able to find a lot of ducks - and I 
mean **a lot** of them, you can sit down in the grass, and you'll be surrounded by a few dozen ducks.

If you're lucky, you'll see swans here. The swans aren't mean and surprisingly they approach humans (or at least they 
approach *me*). They will swim over, and you better have some food ready for them, or they will hiss at you and 
watch you till you manifest some food. They'll eat even regular salad.

If you're super lucky, you'll see lizards crawling around in the bushes alongside the path that leads next to the 
river. You can see fishermen fishing for the plentiful fish here. The river also houses crawfish, although due to the 
crawfish plague spread by the invasive east coast crayfish they're endangered, and you can't touch them.

Finally, there's a ton of nutrias in the river. That's not exactly a good thing, because swamp rats tend to damage the 
ecosystem, so you aren't allowed to feed them. If you feed nutrias, they'll swarm the area. Even better, the remains 
of the food you throw them will lure rats to the area, and they'll swarm together.

The nature around Labe is great too, but I go there mainly for the animals.
