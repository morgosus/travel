Lobkovice is a village and an administrative district of Neratovice. The village itself isn't very large, only 
having a little over 700 inhabitants The interesting parts are its graveyard, church and a château. 

The château is in a pretty dismal state, but it's an interesting piece of history anyways. It has got a small 
courtyard, a protected memorial lindon tree and a river nearby. It can be seen from miles away thanks to its 
heightened location and its large tower.

There is a memorial statue for the fallen soldiers of the First World War in front of the local church. Next to the 
church there's a graveyard of one František Palacký, Czech diplomat who was an important figure during the Czech 
National Revival. He was a historian known as "Otec Národa", which translates to Father of the Nation.

There's also a grave of a Czech diplomat from way back in the first republic (Czechoslovak Republic between 1918 - 
1938, then the Second Republic, after this came the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia, followed by Third Czechoslovak 
Republic and many other reformed republics, which finally stabilized and separated into the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia).
