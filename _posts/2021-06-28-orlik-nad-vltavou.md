It's a really old and beautiful structure. It was built for trade protection in 13th century. As it was used frquently,
it was later refit into a Gothic castle and became a royal castle till the reign of the Holy Roman Emperor
Charles IV.[^orl-1]

The first thing that will strike you is that it's a beautifully preserved white castle surrounded by the Orlík lake.
The landscape around is incredible and looks like something out of a fairy tale. You can walk around the courtyard,
which has small white battlements around it. You can also walk next to the castle and all around it. On the way to
Orlík there's a lot of beautiful valleys, lone trees and forests. If you want to look inside, you'll need a ticket.

Orlík has a bunch of resident peacocks, which roam around freely. They're not afraid of humans, so they're willing to
pose for a photo, even a selfie. If you don't bug them, they'll chill with you in the garden or the surrounding
areas. They might even approach you of their own volition.

There's a lot of trees around, and a lot of them are Lindens. If you come around in Spring or Summer, you'll hear them
buzz... there will be a bee on every blooming branch. As if that's not enough, there a lot of beautiful
flowers, mushrooms and everything else flora has to offer.
