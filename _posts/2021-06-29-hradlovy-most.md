A wooden bridge across the river Vydra. Truth be told, this isn't the original bridge, rather it's a replica of the 
now destroyed bridge. There aren't any bridges like it.

It has a channel into which it directed wooden flotsam... fallen branches, logs, trees fallen by storms (it's high in 
the mountains and a pretty stormy region) and all that. The trees around the place are seriously huge.
