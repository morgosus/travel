I noticed a very nice view of the Holy Trinity Church from its walls' windows as I was climbing the hill leading to 
the gate. While I was at Rabí, or Rábí, the ticket for entry covered only the courtyard. For entering other parts 
you'd need a guide and I'm not really into guided tours, too little freedom. The gate was pretty massive, the area 
looked very defensible... then again, it is a castle.

On the left hand side past the gate there was a stone with a sort of relief of what I'm guessing is a king. Maybe the 
patron saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia.The middle of the courtyard lead into the stables. There also was a small 
catapult, an archery range, a small shop, and a display of birds of prey within the castle walls.

This 13th century ruin sits on top of a hill in the Pilsen region of Czech Republic. Originally it was a Romanesque 
style castle, but it was expanded as the years went by, even adding the gothic architecture up till the 16th 
century.[^rab-1]

The nobles who lived there sided with Emperor Sigismund against the then active Husite movement. The castle was 
besieged and conquered twice by the Husite warlord Jan Žižka of Trocnov a few years after Sigismund had master Jan Hus 
burned at the stake. During this time Jan Žižka lost his eye and gained his iconic visage of a one eyed general.[^rab-2]
