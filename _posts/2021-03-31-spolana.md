Established back in 1900, mainly producing oil, degrass, soap and candles, later reorienting to amonia and similar 
substances, Spolana has a rich history.[^spo-1] Not much of it is interesting, aside from the fact that it leaks chemicals into 
the air pretty often. I remember lots and lots of chemical alerts and even hearing their sirens now and then.

Back in 1950s, Spolana cooperated with the town of Neratovice to turn it into a proper panel town.[^spo-2] Creating the 
Neratovice that stands here today. People from all over flocked here with their families to work in the Spolana Chem 
Plant. This lead to Neratovice oficially becoming a town[^spo-2] (the village, town, etc., titles are subject to how 
many inhabitants the area in question has).

In 1985 Spolana employed a total of 5562 workers.[^spo-2]

In 1965 Spolana used to manufacture Arboricid E (which also contained TCDD) and exported it to America. It's a chemical 
used for destruction of leafed trees and bushes. Now, Spolana apparently didn't know that the American Army 
was misusing it in a 1:1 ratio mix with another chemical to create the infamous Agent Orange for use in the War in 
Vietnam.[^spo-3] I'm not saying this to "tarnish its reputation", but merely because it is a historical fact tied to 
this place. Another fact is the subsequent leak and contamination of three objects in Spolana.[^spo-3]
