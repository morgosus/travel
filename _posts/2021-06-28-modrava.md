An awesome little village and a recreation tourist center, Modrava, is one of Šumava's best regions. There's a few 
houses and lots of nature there. You can find everything from simple chickens and sheep to kangaroos and wild wolves 
there. The chickens are up the hill away from the information center (Locally called "Íčko", which translates to the 
letter í), the kangaroos are in the middle next to the bridge up and if you go the opposite way and up the hill, you'll 
walk straight into an unenclosed forest wolf territory with an entirely lethal pack of wolves.

If you're not into dying horribly at the paws of wild wolves, you may also go visit the Visitor Centre Srní, which has a 
wolf enclosure that's much safer.

The river Vydra flows through here. It's no surprise that you can find otters around the river, as "Vydra" is "An 
otter" in Czech. Other animals include cows, sheep, goats, horses, owls, bats, turkeys, insects, rabbits, and lots of 
deer and does.

Modrava is surrounded by many areas called "Slať" (Tříjezerní Slať, Chalupská Slať, ...), which are peat bogs of the 
Šumava region. There are / were peat mines around a lot of these peat areas. They're a tourist destination as well, 
because the nature in peat bogs is a thing of its own.

You can get up on one of the hills (ideally not the one with wolves) and take a look at the entirety of Modrava from up 
top, as it sits in a sort of minuscule valley, or a hillside surrounded by hills.
